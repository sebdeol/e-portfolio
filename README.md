# Welcome to my ePortfolio!

I'm currently an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Essex (Online).

The aim of this repository is to document and reflect on my studies as I progress through the curriculum.

You can visit the main website by clicking [here](https://sebdeol.github.io/) or you can also browse this repository for the markdown version of all my reflections.

You are more than welcome to reach out to me by [email](mailto:128300508+sebdeol@users.noreply.github.com).
