## Unit 10:

Hello from Week 10! I can’t believe how time has flown. This week was all bout distributed computing and microarchitectures. Work is still keeping me busy in the US but I'm enjoying it quite a lot.

This week we dove deep into the variety of system architectures – from the good old monolithic deployments to the modern, sleek microservices, not forgetting virtualisation and containers. It was like watching the evolution of technology right before my eyes.

We untangled the complexities of why these architectures evolved the way they did and came face to face with the security challenges they bring along. The bigger the system, the bigger the playground for potential attacks, and this week was all about understanding that.

We learned that as we move towards distributed systems, our responsibility to protect the data increases.

The readings were a treasure of knowledge. The work on OWL-SOA presented a fantastic perspective on Service Oriented Architecture, showing its importance during development. The exploration of ontologies in “Ontologies for Industry 4.0” was enlightening, demonstrating how crucial they are for effective knowledge modeling and information retrieval.

The paper on “HybriDG” was fascinating, shining a light on detecting zero-day microarchitectural side-channel attacks. It was a reminder that in the world of distributed computing, staying one step ahead of potential attacks is crucial.

The week ended with exploring a telemonitoring system based on a novel microservice architecture, bringing the discussion to a practical, real-world scenario. It’s amazing to think how these architectures are not just academic concepts but are actively shaping the future of healthcare and beyond.

It reminded me of Babylon Health, now an excting startup, but while I worked there, we were all about using technology to enable better healthcare.

Week 10 was like fitting the pieces of a puzzle together – challenging, enlightening, and obvisoly satisfying. Next week is assignment week!

# Activities

Faceted data refers to a method of organising information, making it easier to filter and retrieve necessary data according to specific criteria. This approach can be beneficial in protecting systems from data leakage, as it allows for fine-grained access control and ensures that users are only able to access the specific data they are authorised to view.

Pros:
Fine-Grained Access Control: By categorising data into different facets, it becomes easier to assign specific access rights based on user roles or requirements.
Improved Data Management: Faceted data allows for more efficient organisation of information, making it easier to manage and retrieve.
Enhanced Security: By limiting access to only the necessary data for each user, the potential for accidental data leakage is reduced.

Cons:
Complexity: Implementing a faceted data model can add complexity to a system, both in terms of development and ongoing maintenance.
Performance Overheads: The additional layers of access control could potentially lead to performance overheads, particularly in systems with large volumes of data.
Potential for Misconfiguration: Like any security system, if not properly configured, a faceted data model could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.


# Python design

Define Data Model: Create classes to represent the different facets of data:

```python3
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, String, Integer
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Base = declarative_base()

class Employee(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'employees'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    department = Column(String)
    role = Column(String)
```

Define Access Control: Create functions/classes to manage access control.

```python3
def get_data_for_user(user_role, department):
    session = Session()
    if user_role == 'manager':
        return session.query(Employee).filter_by(department=department).all()
    elif user_role == 'hr':
        return session.query(Employee).all()
    else:
        return "Access Denied"

```
