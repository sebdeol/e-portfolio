## Study: Why Projects Fail and Gathering Requirements Exercise

Week number two, here we go. Unit 2 had a strong emphasis on exploring and reading why projects fail. I mean, just type in into Google: `why do projects fail in project management` and you'll have more reading material than you can ingest for the next decade:

After reading the given materials and also researching on my own, it's becoming quite clear to me why projects fail. The common and recurring pitfalls are:
- Lack of planning
- Unclear goals
- Scope creep (or requirements changes)
- Poor communication.

I felt that this unit was lacking a bit of material. Unit 2 could have provided analysis to the underlying factors that contribute to these issues and how to prevent them. Similarly, no real introduction to Gherkin was given. I mean, don't get me wrong, I know this is an MSc module, I am expected to research on my own, but still. Anyway, regarding Gherkin, I think this syntax has a place in SEPM. I've read a few articles and all I'm taking away is that you can combine the tickets requirements with your code and use them for tests, pretty cool. (Writing better user stories with Gherkin and Cucumber - The Loop, n.d.). This way you can be sure that you've developed exactly what the business needs. Is it still relevant in 2024? Maybe, I don't know - all I know is that tech is a fast moving space. I wouldn't be surprised if people come up with a newer and better alternative soon.
