## Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing

Week 6! We're half way there!

This week, I studied linters and their vital part in enhancing Python code quality. While linters don't make your code better per say, they definetely help you in your day to day job and take away some cognitive load to help you better focus on the code.

Working with various linters, I discovered that while they aim to achieve similar goals, each has its unique strengths and applicability in different scenarios. They act as vigilant watchdogs, ensuring code consistency and helping to catch potential errors before they escalate.

I've experimented with a few different linters this week, Flake8, Pylama, Pylint, Ruff just to name a few. My favourite is Ruff. It's light and blazing fast. I think I'll use it for the coding output in week 11.

The readings, particularly "Secure Feature Driven Development (SFDD) Model" by Firdaus, Ghani, and Jeong, provided valuable insights into integrating security at the developmental stage. This connection between high-quality code and security is crucial, and it’s something I’m now more mindful of.

Reflecting on this week’s learnings, I realise how integral tools like linters are in supporting the development of secure and high-quality software. I never thought that a tool like a linter could make you a better developer, but this week I've been proven wrong!

This week we also had to submit the Design Document as a team. We met with my fellow students a couple of times to discuss how to design our application.
We have choosen a Learning Management System (LMS) application for a school. As a current student, this made perfect sense to me!

I believe we did good, we received a 69% grade, 1 mark off the distinction level! Not bad, but I'm a bit gutted. Hopefully, we can get there on the next assignment.
