## Estimating, Planning and Risk

In unit 3, we explored some more concepts in the project management space, such as estimation, planning, and risk. The unit highlighted and explored the importance of accurate estimation, proper planning, and comprehensive risk assessment in software project management.


### e-Portfolio Activity: Data Structures Reflection
As I use the UoEO platform nearly every day, I thought I would analyse and reflect on it. If I were to build something similar myself, this is how I would do it:

- I would use hash tables for user authentication, mapping the student's username to its password with constant time complexity (0(1)).
- For the course content, I would use Trees (such as Binary Search Trees) to keep all the content organised hierarchically.
- For managing the relationship between students, courses, and activities, I would use Graphs.
- Finally, I'd use queues for task scheduling, for example, for sending reminder emails for upcoming assignments.

Dicheva & Hodge (2018) emphasise that active learning and engagement with data structures is crucial for an LMS' content and user interactions. For example, implementing quizzes or forums requires efficient data handling to maintain system performance and user experience. The use of appropriate data structures ensures that the LMS remains responsive and reliable, even under heavy load.
