## Quality Management Strategy

I won't reflect much on this unit as I'd rather focus on the python exercise, but overall, this week provided various metrics and strategies for quality management. I also learned about the critical role of planning to prevent technical debt and to ensure the delivery of high quality software.

##Â e-Portfolio Activity: Improving Code Quality

This is some example of some old code that I wrote in the past:

```python3
sales_data = [
    {'date': '2024-01-01', 'sales': 100},
    {'date': '2024-01-02', 'sales': 200},
    {'date': '2024-01-03', 'sales': 300},
    {'date': '2024-01-04', 'sales': 400}
]

def calculate_total_average(data):
    total_sales = sum(item['sales'] for item in data)
    average_sales = total_sales / len(data)
    return total_sales, average_sales

def filter_high_sales(data, threshold):
    high_sales = [sale for sale in data if sale['sales'] > threshold]
    return high_sales

total, average = calculate_total_average(sales_data)
high_sales = filter_high_sales(sales_data, 250)

print("Total Sales:", total)
print("Average Sales:", average)
print("High Sales:", high_sales)
```

Not bad in my opinion, but there is definetely room for improvement here.

Here is what I would do now:

```python3
def calculate_total_average(data: list[dict[str, int]]) -> tuple[int, float]:
    """
    Calculate the total and average sales from a list of sales data.

    Parameters:
    data (list[dict[str, int]]): List of dictionaries

    Returns:
    tuple[int, float]: Total sales and average sales.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If data list is empty.
    """
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("Data list is empty, cannot calculate the total and average.")

    total_sales = sum(item['sales'] for item in data)
    average_sales = total_sales / len(data)
    return total_sales, average_sales

def filter_high_sales(data: list[dict[str, int]], threshold: int) -> list[dict[str, int]]:
    """
    Filter sales data to find days with sales exceeding a given threshold.

    Parameters:
    data (list[dict[str, int]]): List of dictionaries
    threshold (int): Sales threshold to filter by.

    Returns:
    list[dict[str, int]]: List of dictionaries with sales above the threshold.
    """
    return [sale for sale in data if sale['sales'] > threshold]

def main():
    sales_data = [
        {'date': '2024-01-01', 'sales': 100},
        {'date': '2024-01-02', 'sales': 200},
        {'date': '2024-01-03', 'sales': 300},
        {'date': '2024-01-04', 'sales': 400}
    ]

    try:
        total, average = calculate_total_average(sales_data)
        print("Total Sales:", total)
        print("Average Sales:", average)

        high_sales = filter_high_sales(sales_data, 250)
        print("High Sales:", high_sales)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

List of improvements:
- Modular Design: By structuring the code into functions and a main execution block, the code is more organised and easier to change if needed. Each function does one thing (Single Responsibility Principle (Wikipedia, 2021)).

- Type Annotations and Documentation: The use of type hints enhances readability and debugging. The docstrings provide clear descriptions of the functions' purposes and parameters.

- Error Handling: Adding error checks prevents common errors like division by zero when the data list is empty, enhancing the robustness of the code.
