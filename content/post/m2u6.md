## Abstract Methods and Interfaces

Unit 6, we're half way there! This week was all about interfaces in Python. I discovered that interfaces are fundamental for designing good classes. They help keep things consistent and well-encapsulated. To go the extra mile, I also read another realpython.com article on Python Interfaces (Python, n.d.).

In Chapter 9 of "Python 3 Object-oriented Programming" (3rd ed., Packt Publishing, 2018), Philips introduces decorators as a tool for modifying the behaviour of functions. This allows developers to add functionality to existing methods to enhance their capability and keep things lean. To understand this further, I wrote a small python decorator myself, the snippet is below.

## Python decorator example

```python3
def decorator_example(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After the function is called.")
        return result

    return wrapper


@decorator_example
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


say_hello("Sebastien")
```

## Output

```bash
Before the function is called.
Hello, Sebastien!
After the function is called.
```

I won't lie, getting my head around the practical application of interfaces was tough, but hands-on coding exercises helped _a bit_.

Another 6 weeks to go, I can't wait for two weeks off, I won't lie, I'm pretty tired at this point.
