## Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design

This week, we explored the world of interviews, survey methods, and questionnaires. I did not learn this during this unit, but it was reinforced that interviews can provide good feedback via the one-on-one conversation medium. This allows researchers to gather detailed and qualitative data. On the other hand, online surveys, are a quantitative method used to gather opinions and trends from a much larger sample.
