## Software Development Life Cycles

In unit 7, we focused on the many aspects of the Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs) and their overall impact on project management.
The two main focus points were the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. I have had exposure to both methodologies, but I am by no means an expert. In our previous group task, we decided to use the Waterfall approach (which I personally think is quite outdated), I'd have rather used the Agile approach which fits more with my approach of doing things, small iterations that always give the user a bit more than what they had before.

## Group task

I have received my grade for the group task assignment, not bad, but not my highest grade ever. I can relate to the feedback given by the tutor. A good start and a poor finish, exactly what I said to the group a couple of days prior to the submission. Actually, as I have written most of the beginning of the assignment, it was a good testimony of my abilities. But still, I was quite dissapointed with the grade. In the next group task, if something similar happens, I'd like to better influence the group to ensure I'm 100% happy with the final submission.
