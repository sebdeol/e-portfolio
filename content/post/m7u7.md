## Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing

This week is formative assessment week! Indeed, the literature review is due at the end of this unit.
I am not entirely sure how I feel about my submission. I _think_ I did okay but I guess I won't be sure until I get the grades back.

I will reflect very little this week as the e-Portfolio assessment is quite comprehensive. We have had to do a lot of Excel exercises. Everything is linked below.
