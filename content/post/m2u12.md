# Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code

That's it, we've reached the final week of this module!

I'm still in the US with work, and if I am being completely honest, I need to work on my studies a bit harder. I barely touched the final reflection piece. It should be 1000 words so I really need to focus so that I can submit it in time.

In this unit, there was some interresting reading materials, from Factory design pattern to reusable object-oriented software!

This week, I learned that multiple design patterns can co-exist in a single code base. At the moment, I am not sure how I would apply those myself in any code structure, but I'll keep exploring. To be a bit more critical, the Zhang & Budgen's article was written back in 2011, that's 12 years ago now. I believe coding and languages have come a long way since then, so I am questioning whether this paper is still relevant today (in 2023).

That's a wrap for this module!

I have definitely learned a lot. It's not been easy by any means, and I still have lots to learn, but I'll admit it, it's pretty rewarding to see the progress I've made so far.
