## Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations

Reflecting on unit 4, I am only now starting to understand how much work I will need to put in for my capstone project.
There are some many things to consider, research and think about. I have to admit that right now, it feels quite overwhelming.

This week, we explored case studies and focus groups. I like the idea of focus groups and I'd love to have at least one in my capstone project. But as of right now, as I am not entirely sure what the subject of my final project will be, it seems unlikely I could even gather a group of people together. I guess this will become more concrete in the coming weeks.

### Formative Activities
#### Literature Review Outline

This week I submitted my Literature Review outline for formative assessment. Reading the feedback from the tutor, I am glad I did submit it. I was focusing on too many details and I had way too many directions for the maximum word count (2000 words). The tutor's feedback has enabled me to think on how to refocus on the essentials for my summative review.
