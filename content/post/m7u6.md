## Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

Half way there! This week actually brings me some much needed relief. The doubling-up of modules is finally over. I have managed to submit my last assignment in my other module. This means I can solely focus on this module for the next six weeks.

This week, we explored the world of quantitative methods. I learned that quantitative methods investigate the relationships between variables that are measured numerically. These relationships can then be analysed to uncover patterns and test various hypotheses.

After this week, I feel more confident to apply descriptive statistics in my future projects.
