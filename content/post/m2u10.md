# Testing Code in Practice

I started week 10 by keeping my promise. I posted on the Unit 8 forum, I actually posted two messages.
The first message was replying to a fellow student. I managed to critically respond and pinpoint a potential flaw in their discussion.
I brought to light the vulnerabilities of IoT systems and how it could potentially impact the systems and brand reputation.
The second message was my initial post. I won't post it here because it's quite lenghty, but I'm pretty happy about it. Prior to writing the post, I had no idea what a metamodel was. I guess you lean everyday. I did appreciate that a fellow student replied to me, it opened my perspective into things I didn't consider before.

Later during this week, I dipped my toes into unit testing and got hands-on with pylint for style checking. It was rewarding to see how these tools can pinpoint potential bugs and ensure readability. Pylint, in particular, felt like having a personal code mentor, which is great.

As mentionned in an earlier post, I am now in the US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ for 3 weeks. I'll be honest, between the time difference, work, my studies and the two assigments to submit in the next two weeks, I'll be struggling to keep up. I'll promise do my best though.
