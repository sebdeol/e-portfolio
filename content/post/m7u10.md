# Research Writing

Nearly there - as I finish unit 10, I am starting to feel tired. This module workload has been beyond everything I've studied so far for my MSc. The tutor wasn't lying when she said that the module was intense.

You can tell that this week's content tied together all the work I've done so far. I don't see myself as a strong writer, so I'm committed to learn as much as I can from this unit.

In this unit I also had to submit my second assignment for this module, a Research Proposal Presentation. I feel quite confident. I spent a good amount of time preparing for it. I'll keep you posted when I get the grades back.

## e-Portfolio Assessment

#### Statistical worksheets for formative feedback

I did not submit my worksheets for formative feedback as I understood the assignment correctly.

I have linked all the exercises in [unit 7](/post/m7u7/), [unit 8](/post/m7u8/) and [unit 9](/post/m7u9/)
