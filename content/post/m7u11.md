# Going Forward: Professional Development and Your e-Portfolio

For this particular unit, we've had to complete three different documents. This was quite time consuming and I've spent a couple of days thinking about how best to fill the Action Plan, the SWOT and the Skills Matrix.

For full disclosure, I have never had to do any of those, so it was actually quite hard to get started and to keep going.

However, I am quite please with how I filled out each document. You can find all the documents below.
