## UML

The third week of the module was all about getting to know the Unified Modelling Language (UML). I have to be honest, I had never heard of it prior to starting this unit.
However, the deeper I studied UML's shared syntax and models, the clearer it became how useful it is in making sure everyone is on the same page when designing an application.

One thing that really caught my attention was how different UML models come into play at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). For example, use case diagrams come in handy during the requirements gathering phase. Class diagrams, on the other hand, focus more on the system's structure and make more sense to use during the design phase.

### Activities

Below is my implementation of the washing machine state machine diagram

I am pretty sure it captures the basic functionality of a washing machine, however, I could have added more details. For example, washing machines have a multitude of programs these days, so I could have reflected that here. I just did not think it was necessary.

All in all, this week explained how critical UML and upfront design is when it comes to software systems, especially in an object-oriented context.

Bring on next week!
