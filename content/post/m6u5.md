## User Experience

In unit 5, we explored User Experience (UX), and realistically, I knew nothing about UX so I was hoping to learn a lot this week.

When I first opened the unit page on the university learning web app, I did not understand why we had a whole unit on UX in a project management module. However, after this week, I appreciate the learning. Project management is a multifaceted role, so it became clear that a project manager is also responsible to orchestrate all the UX efforts.

I started the unit with the recommended readings. I have particularly enjoyed the case study by Lopes et al. (2018). I have learned a lot about how the design of mobile applications impacts users. The article provided clear methods to engage the stakeholders and how to prioritise their needs. I think this is quite essential, otherwise, you will create software that does not resonate with users. How many times have you been frustrated with an application on your phone? I think we can all relate to this, if an app isn't good or straightforward to use, there is a strong chance the user engagement will be low. Personally, the first thing I do when I can't understand how an app works is to simply delete it from my phone. This is probably the worst outcome for UX, PMs, developers, and any business.

In this unit, we also explored Test-driven development (TDD). I have a few friends that are software developers, and they all tell me how much they enjoy it. I understand the concept as a whole, write your tests first, then your code. This is to make sure your code does what you want it to. However, I can't fully grasp it, surely your code won't be working the very first time? Also, how can you be sure that the test that you wrote makes sense and is in-line with the specification? I don't know, maybe this is something that you "just get" once you have enough experience. I have used the pytest library in the past, and it's quite simple to use. It has many available APIs making writing tests a breeze.


Here are my overall learnings from this unit:

- Write a project plan. Explicitly incorporates UX goals and metrics from the outset, to align project objectives with user expectations.
- Define a UX strategy: Get regular user feedback from testing sessions and adapt the project based on the data gathered.
- Always implement testing in Python

## Group task

From the group task, I have submitted the very first draft, as agreed this week. The feedback has been super positive, I'm super pleased with it; but don't take my word for it, here are two screenshots of our group chat:
