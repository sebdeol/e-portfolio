## Unit 2: Exploring Software Security and UML Flow Charts

Hello again! We’ve now fully back into study mode in this second week. This week we further looked into Agile and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This week I also wrote my UML flow chart and posted on the University's forum to discuss my findings. As discussed in the last unit, I choose BOLA. I've attached my Initial Post below if you want to read it.

This week, we also focused on understanding how to effectively imcorporate security practices at each stage of the agile SDLC. I think I like the SCRUM approach, quick iterations and focus on particular pieces of work. I'd also like to try the KANBAN approach, knowing myself, I know that I would prefer less ceremonies, especially we have a one or two weeks sprints. I feel like having sprint planning and retrospectives all the time sounds a bit repetitive.

Software security sound quite daunting, but this week proved it’s all about getting comfortable with it. We took a deep dive into the ISO/IEC Standard on security, and suddenly, all those complex terms and concepts started to make sense. It’s like learning a new language, but better as you get to keep the bad guys out!

Week 2 has been a blend of theoretical understanding and practical application. I think I'm better equipped to tackle the challenges of secure software development.

## Activities

Initial Post

One weakness in software development that the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP, n.d) has highlighted is the insecure design and implementation of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Modern web and mobile applications rely on APIs for their core communications with backend services, making them a prime target for malicious actors.

RESTful APIs (RedHat, 2020), are the foundation of modern application architectures. APIs can expose sensitive data or even allow unauthorised access when poorly protected. The OWASP API Security Top 10 highlights the importance of this topic with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) (OWASP, 2023).

BOLA emerges when an API endpoint fails to implement proper controls to verify if the user is authorised to access the specific data they are requesting. To illustrate this, consider a scenario where a healthcare application provides an API endpoint to retrieve patients profiles. If an attacker can manipulate the endpoint by changing the user ID in the request without any access restrictions, they can fetch details of any user, not just their own.

In 2019, a critical bug was discovered on Uber APIs that allowed attackers to steal valuable data, including personally identifiable information (PII) records and authentication tokens of riders and drivers. The leaked authentication token could be used to perform a full account takeover. (Traceable App & API Security, 2021)

APIs are crucial in today's software landscape, but insufficient safeguards can introduce grave consequences such as financial losses and damage to reputation. Strzelecki and Rizun (2022) noted that about one-third of users impacted by data breaches will stop using the affected platform.
