## Python Data Structures

Data structures, here we go! In previous modules, I have already explored a few of Python's data structures. If I had to list my favourite four, they would be:

- Lists - They are quite versatile and easy to use.
- Dictionaries - We can't go wrong with key-value pairs storage. Dictionaries also allow for fast searching.
- Sets - Super useful for storing unique items.
- Tuples - Perfect for immutable sequences such as records that shouldn’t be modified.


I was browsing the IEEE Spectrum website and was reading a few articles on the latest advancements in IoT devices. I thought it would be useful to me to explore a new data structure concept. I identified some data from an article that requires quick read and write (spectrum.ieee.org, n.d.) and decided to use Python's deque (docs.python.org, n.d.). Below is a simple Python script to simulate the storage and retrieval of such data:

```python3
# Simulating sensor data storage
sensor_data = {
    'temperature_sensor': deque(),
    'pressure_sensor': deque(),
    'humidity_sensor': deque()
}

# Function to add data to sensors
def add_sensor_data(sensor_name, data):
    sensor_data[sensor_name].append(data)

# Function to retrieve latest data from sensor
def get_latest_sensor_data(sensor_name):
    return sensor_data[sensor_name][-1]

# Example usage
add_sensor_data('temperature_sensor', 22.5)
add_sensor_data('pressure_sensor', 101.3)
print(get_latest_sensor_data('temperature_sensor'))  # Output: 22.5
```
