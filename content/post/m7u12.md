# Project Management and Managing Risk

And that's it, final unit for this project. I won't lie, it's been a long and tough twelve weeks.

This module was no joke; the content was plentiful and abundant. I have had to juggle two modules at the same time for six weeks, while still working full time. Let's just say that I am happy it's coming to an end.

I have definitely learned a lot, but I reserve that for my summative reflections. I'll make sure to provide a link when it's finished.

This probably also marks the end of my e-portfolio for taught modules. Thanks for making it until here. I hope you've enjoyed my MSc study journey.

Take care, Sebastien.
