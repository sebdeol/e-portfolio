## More on Classes

In unit 5, I explored deeper into Python and object-oriented programming (OOP). The readings helped me with concepts like abstract classes and constructors.

I also explored polymorphism and composition. These concepts opened my perspective on how to make my code more modular. I found namespaces and packages interesting, as they help avoid naming clashes. I had no idea this was a thing in Python.

Another week and another ton of learning. I feel a bit more confident in creating Python classes. After reading some more materials, I _believe_ I understand polymorphism and composition. Below you will find my polymorphic driveless car design!

On another note, work just informed me that I will need to travel and stay in the US for 3 weeks. This might be an extra challenge for me as it's during the last three weeks of the module. I just looked and we have two assignments to hand over during these weeks. It will be a challenge to keep work and my studies afloat!

### Polymorphic driverless car design

```python3
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Car(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def drive(self):
        pass


class Tesla(Car):
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def drive(self):
        return (
            f"The {self.model} is driving autonomously using Tesla's Autopilot system."
        )


class Waymo(Car):
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def drive(self):
        return f"The {self.model} is driving autonomously using Waymo's self-driving technology."


def main():
    model_S = Tesla("Model S")
    print(model_S.drive())

    waymo_car = Waymo("Waymo car")
    print(waymo_car.drive())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

### Output

```bash
The Model S is driving autonomously using Tesla's Autopilot system.
The Waymo car is driving autonomously using Waymo's self-driving technology.
```
