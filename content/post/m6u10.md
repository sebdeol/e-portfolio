## Software Quality Monitoring in Python

Again, for this unit, I won't reflect with a lot of words, I think it's better to keep focused on the activity below.

## Activity: Using Linters to Achieve Python Code Quality

We were tasked with analysing some python code using different linters.

I have run the code through four linters as suggested, but I also researched the latest on the web, and I saw that Ruff (docs.astral.sh, n.d.) is picking up some momentum. So I've added it to the list and ran the code against it.

Click on the name of the linter to see the text results:

- [Pylint](https://github.com/sebdeol/e-portfolio/tree/main/content/activities/module_ten/pylint_results.txt)
- [Pyflakes](https://github.com/sebdeol/e-portfolio/tree/main/content/activities/module_ten/pyflakes_results.txt)
- [pycodestyle](https://github.com/sebdeol/e-portfolio/tree/main/content/activities/module_ten/pycodestyle_results.txt)
- [pydocstyle](https://github.com/sebdeol/e-portfolio/tree/main/content/activities/module_ten/pydocstyles_results.txt)
- [Ruff](https://github.com/sebdeol/e-portfolio/tree/main/content/activities/module_ten/ruff_results.txt)

You can clearly see that each one of them do perform slightly different from each other. Some are more focusing on code while some focus more on style. Overall, if I had to choose one from these results, I would probably use PyLint as it appears to provide the best result.
