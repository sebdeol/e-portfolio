# Validity and Generalisability in Research

This week I will not reflect a lot. Again the exercises have been quite challenging as I've never really used Excel in that manner before.

While I did enjoy doing all the data analysis via the exercises, I won't lie, it was tough. I am by no means a data expert. At least I've learned new skills in this unit, which is always a plus.
