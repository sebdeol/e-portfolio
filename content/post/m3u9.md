## Unit 9: Developing an API for a Distributed Environment

If you thought the past weeks were intense, brace yourself! Week 9 has thrown me right into the thick of developing APIs for a distributed environment. With work in the US and my studies ramping up, itâ€™s been a tough week, but hey, what's life without a challenge or two?

Diving right into the nitty-gritty, we looked at CRUD capabilities in Python. For those of you wondering, CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete - basic operations that, when you think about it, we use in just about every application! Paired with Python libraries, the possibilities felt endless.

Then there's Flask. I've got to admit, as someone who's dabbled in Python before, Flask was a love at first sight. Building an API with Flask felt intuitive, and it gave me a newfound respect for back-end developers everywhere.

Creating an API to perform file management felt like piecing together a puzzle - challenging, but oh-so-satisfying once it comes together. And I've got to say, the user interface is where the magic really happens for the user, but the real grunt work is in the back-end, making everything tick.

"The Evolution of Distributed Systems towards Microservices Architectures" reading material was particularly insightful, shedding light on how software development has morphed over time.

My top takeaway from the additional reading? The paper on the RESTful API in a health registration system. It brought home the real-world implications and applications of what we're learning. Imagine streamlining healthcare with efficient APIs! The possibilities are staggering.

In closing, Week 9 was a rollercoaster, but it's added another string to my bow. With APIs now under my belt, I feel a step closer to being a holistic developer. On to the next challenge! Week 10, I'm ready for you!

## Activities

Here's a simple library CRUD app written in flask

```python3
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, url_for
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////library.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Book(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    author = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    year = db.Column(db.Integer)

@app.get('/')
def index():
    books = Book.query.all()
    return render_template('index.html', books=books)

@app.post('/add')
def add_book():
    title = request.form.get('title')
    author = request.form.get('author')
    year = request.form.get('year')
    book = Book(title=title, author=author, year=year)
    db.session.add(book)
    db.session.commit()
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

@app.post('/update/<int:id>')
def update_book(id):
    book = Book.query.get(id)
    book.title = request.form.get('title')
    book.author = request.form.get('author')
    book.year = request.form.get('year')
    db.session.commit()
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

@app.delete('/delete/<int:id>')
def delete_book(id):
    book = Book.query.get(id)
    db.session.delete(book)
    db.session.commit()
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()
    app.run(debug=True)

```
