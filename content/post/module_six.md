Welcome back to my e-portfolio and to the Software Engineering Project Management module!

As usual, here's a small extract from the course's website:

_In this module, you will be exposed to what it means to be a Project Manager of a software engineering project. We will examine the relationships between the Project Manager and the other stakeholders in a project, and the role that the Project Manager has in ensuring that the triple constraints of project management are balanced, and any technical debt is not accrued. From a more practical perspective, we will consider how the needs of the customer are responded to through the use of test-driven development and behaviour-driven development._


Here are my 12 weeks worth of self reflection broken down by units.
