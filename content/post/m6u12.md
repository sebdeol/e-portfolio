## The Case for the Future Direction of Software Engineering Project Management

Final week of this module! Time flies! I can't believe it's already been 12 weeks. This module just flew by.

I have appreciated this module in its entirety. Even though I did mention in unit 1 that I don't particularly envisage a career in product management. The module was well structured and definitely kept me busy. We had a lot of materials and activities to complete, and I can assure you that I spent a few nights understanding how everything fit together.

I'll reflect more in my individual piece, but I have really enjoyed this module as I got introduced to concepts I had never experienced before. The tutor was also very engaging. You can clearly tell he has a passion for project management.

Thanks a lot for reading my project management reflections. I hope you managed to get a small glimpse of my studies.
