## Software Engineering Project Management: Future Trends

Welcome to unit 11, the next to last for this module. This week, I'll mainly reflect on the assignment that I had to submit.

Following the group task assignment in unit 6, we were now given the assignment of a follow-up meeting happening 12 months later. The meeting is to give a project update to the main stakeholders. This was individual task. We had to record a 20 minutes presentation and provide a full transcript of the video.

I will have to admit, that I hate the sound of my voice. I've had a hard time listening back to it. I also found this to be quite challenging. I had never recorded any presentation before where I had to speak for 20 minutes straight. Quite a challenge as I do struggle with public speaking. Maybe you can tell it by the way I write? I don't know. Anyway, overall, I was quite happy with my submission. I am yet to get the grading on it, but I'll keep you updated in my next reflection.

One thing that I struggled with as well was submitting the video. As it was 20 minutes long, it was quite big. I did compress it but it was still a chunky 500mb. The university portal only allows files up to 50mb. I had to upload the video to Youtube. Hopefully I don't get marked down for this.
