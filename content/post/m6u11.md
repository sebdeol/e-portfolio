## Software Engineering Project Management: Future Trends

Welcome to unit 11, the next to last for this module. This week, I'll mainly reflect on the assignment that I had to submit.

Following the group task assignment in unit 6, we were now given the assignment of a follow-up meeting happening 12 months later. The meeting is to give a project update to the main stakeholders. This was an individual task. We had to record a 20 minute presentation while also providing a full transcript of the video.

I struggled on two aspects this week, the first one was submitting the video. As it was 20 minutes long, it was quite big. I did compress it but it was still a chunky 500mb. The university portal only allows files up to 50mb. I had to upload the video to Youtube so hopefully I don't get marked down for this.

The second one was having to record a presentation where I had to speak for 20 uninterrupted minutes. Quite a challenge as I do struggle with public speaking. I'd like to think that I am a better writer than speaker. Overall, I had mixed feelings about my submission but hopefully, I met the requirements set by the tutor. I am yet to receive the grading on it, but I'll keep you updated in my next reflection.
