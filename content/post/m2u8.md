##Â Data Structures and Data Search in Practice

This week I was looking into set operations and linear data search techniques. I got to see first-hand how set operations like union, intersection, and others work when handling complex data. I can see how I would apply set operations in my driverless car system design and more specifically in sensors data. This would need to store and handle lots of data so it seems like a perfect match from what I learned.

Working through a linear data search technique was a real eye-opener. I mean, it might not be the fastest search algorithms, but it definitely gave me some insight on how searching works in a dataset. Plus, it made me realise it can be a lifesaver in those real-world IoT systems like driverless cars, where data is all over the place and always on the move.

Through all this and work being super busy, I didn't have the change to post my initial group discussion on the forum. I know this is important, so I'll make sure I'll do it before the end of the module. I'll also try to reply to a fellow student.
